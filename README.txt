WhoTweetedThis (http://whotweetedthis.appspot.com) is a web app that looks up for links in your twitter timeline.

It is written in python and running on the google app engine. 

The design is by www.evstyle.de (@evStyleDesign) the code by www.tabard.fr (@aurelient)

There is no license so far (I guess GPL or MIT license will soon).
